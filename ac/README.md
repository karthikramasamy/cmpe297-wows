Actor critic is a variation on policy gradients.In Actor Critic Approach, The Q function can be broken down into two parts.
○ Value Function (V) estimates the value based on the state (s).
○ Advantage Function (A) calculates how much value of a state changes given an action (a).

In this project we use actor-critic to optimize returns of trading agent over a run of two correlated stocks in a pairs trading setting.
