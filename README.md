## Stock Trading using Reinforcement Learning by Team WoWS

This project applies three different reinforcement learning methodologies to the stock trading use case to study their strengths and weaknesses. We aim to create an environment that allows an agent with a given RL strategy to train and optimize the buying, holding, and selling of a given stock so as to maximize profit. We will compare the performances of each model and present the results.
